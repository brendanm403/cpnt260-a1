Above and Beyond

  I asked you if it was okay to experiment with flexbox in this assignment and you said sure.
  I turned the top section of the page into a flex container (index.html line 18, style.css line 68), wrapped all the album info and rating in a div (index.html line 19) and used justify content to center the album info and album art image. 

  I ended up using divs to wrap the track list and review content and centered them that way rather than applying margin auto
  to the main element. Doing it this way helps me keep track of the content inside because i can give the class applied to the div
  content specific names. (index.html line 30, 46)

  Added an image (index.html line 25)

  used fontawesome to get the star icons for the rating (index.html line 10, 23)
