      <h2 class="review-title"><em>A Timeless Classic</em></h2>
      <p>In 2015 this piece of art was the first metal album to be selected for preservation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recording_Registry">National Recording Registry.</a> And for good Reason. Every song on this album plays an important role in forming the iconic sound this album has. That being said I will be focusing on the brightest of highlights for this review and I will start with the title track.</p>
      <p>"Master Of Puppets" is quite possibly <strong>the greatest metal anthem of all time.</strong> This song has everything from fast memorable riffs and solos,
        to a beautiful slow melodic section with harmonies in the middle of the composition. This is a song that will be forever culturally relevant with many appearances in various media and tons of air time at sporting events. Chances are you know the song even if you think you don't!</p>
      <p>"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" is the fourth track of the album. This song's placement is perfect as it is a bit of a cool down from the blistering thrash metal that comes before it. Until the outro that is. The majority of the song has a sombre melodic feel that builds up into an intense outro with fantastic riffs that will get your head banging! Metallica has a great talent for blending melody with intensity and aggression and this song is a perfect example of that.</p>
      <p>"Orion" is an instrumental track that displays the bands ability to write unique and soulful music without the need for vocals. The song is over 8 minutes long and at no point do you find yourself wondering when it will end. Metallica's late Bassist Cliff Burton shines on this track and the song is forever a testament to his skill and ability to compose music.</p>
      <p>Overall, this record is a staple in any metal collection. This album is also a great choice for any first time thrash metal listener. It is in fact, an absolute banger!</p>
